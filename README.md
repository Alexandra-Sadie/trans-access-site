# Trans Access Site Prototype

## What's this app?

This is a prototype of CURE Concordia's Trans Access Site. We've built out a basic site architecture as a foundation for future work. As a finished product, this site will help trans people in Quebec find accessible, quality medical, legal, and community care.

The live version of this app can be found [here](https://trans-access-site.web.app/).
