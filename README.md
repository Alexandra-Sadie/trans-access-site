# Trans Access Site Prototype

## What's this app?

This is a prototype of CURE Concordia's Trans Access Site. We've built out a basic site architecture as a foundation for future work. As a finished product, this site will help trans people in Quebec find accessible, quality medical, legal, and community care.

The live version of this app can be found [here](https://trans-access-site.web.app/).

## Tech we use

Beyond a knowledge of HTML and CSS and JS basics, we use these more complex technologies - we hope to provide enough information, eventually, that someone who only knows HTML CSS and JS can contribute to the application, for now here are some basics.

### React

React is a modern web framework that allows you to create advanced web browser applications. It is the basis for all of our work.

For documentation please see React's excellent official [getting started guide](https://react.dev/learn) which is designed for beginners and very easy to use.

_todo_
-explain single page app concept

### MUI

MUI is a component library for React, based off of Google's Material Design 2.0 design spec.

MUI's documentation is [here](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/)

_todo_

- explain components more
- more theory of MUI
- explain Material Design
- link to Material Design docs

### React Router

React Router is a routing library, that is primarily used to make the routes that you see in the url bar of the browser interact with, and provide their own data to React, in order to display particular pages correctly.

React Router has a decent [official tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) but we actually reccomend reading their [main concepts page](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/concepts) to really understand what is going on

_todo_

- explain how BrowserRouter works in our app
- explain RouterLink import maybe
