<!-- This is an HTML document that React uses to generate a one-page app. React does a lot of JavaScript and DOM manipulation to render content from JS files onto this page, but technically it's being done in this file.
If ye come here searching for meaningful HTML turn back! Try README.md or index.js instead for good entry points into the application.

    <!-- It's not visible in this file, but under the hood, React uses a tool called Webpack and "html-webpack-plugin" to insert a <script> into this html page, which calls the rest of our React app in turn. -->
    <!-- More specifically, it inserts the "const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))" function from index.js, and runs it here. The next line, "root.render", renders the entirety of our app. -->
