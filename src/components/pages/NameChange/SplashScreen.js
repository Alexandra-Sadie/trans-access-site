              This is a tool to help trans people in Quebec better understand
              what they need to get a legal name and/or gender marker change.
              The process can be a bit complicated, and different documents or
              steps can be required based on factors like age, citizenship
              status, or time spent in Quebec.

              Because there are so many variables, we've made a short
              questionnaire to determine what documents or steps you'll need. As
              you answer questions about your situation, you'll see a checklist
              of requirements, which you can save after the quiz to track your
              progress.
